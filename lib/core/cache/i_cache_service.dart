// Marker classes used to distinguish feature-specific cache services.
// The core issue was that multiple HiveCacheService instances shared the same 
// base interface (ICacheService), making it difficult for the DI system to 
// differentiate between them.
//
// To solve this, a generic type parameter <R> was added to ICacheService solely 
// for differentiation â€” it does not affect implementation logic. These empty 
// marker classes (e.g., MarketFeature, SettingsFeature) act as compile-time 
// tags to indicate which feature a particular HiveCacheService belongs to.

/// This abstraction allows the underlying cache implementation
/// to be swapped without affecting the data sources that use it.

/// injection and service differentiation. It has no impact on the runtime
/// behavior or the types of values stored in the cache.
